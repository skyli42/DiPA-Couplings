\section{Related Work}
The DiPA model and counterexamples to privacy are drawn from \cite{chadhaLinearTimeDecidability2021}. Approximate liftings were developed in \cite{bartheKopfOlmedo2012ProbabilisticRelationalReasoningforDifferentialPriv,BartheOlmedo2013} and applied to algorithms such as SVT in \cite{BartheEtAl2016}.
A full exploration of approximate liftings can be found in \cite{HsuThesis2017}. \cite{AlbarghouthiHsu2018} uses couplings; and in particular the ``shift'' couplings family we use, to create a heuristiccally successful program for proving the correctness of possible differentially private algorithms.
