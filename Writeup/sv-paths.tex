\subsection{Program Paths}

We now demonstrate how to concatenate transitions and their corresponding coupling strategies together into program \textit{paths}.

\begin{defn}[Program paths]
    Let $\Sigma_T$ be a valid transition alphabet with underlying location space $Q$. A program \textbf{path} is a sequence of transitions $t_0\cdot t_1\cdot \ldots\cdot t_{n-1}$ such that for all $i\in 0\ldots n-1$, $t_i = (q_i, q_{i+1}, c_i, \sigma_i, \tau_i)$ for some $c_i, \sigma_i, \tau_i$. We will often notate an path $\rho$ as $\rho = q_0\to q_1\to \ldots \to q_n$. 

    If a path $\rho$ is of the form $\rho = t_{init}\cdot \rho'$ for $\rho'\in \Sigma_T^*$, then we call $\rho$ a \textbf{complete} path. 
\end{defn}

The length of a path $\rho$ is simply the number of transitions that are concatenated together to form $\rho$. 

We define some useful notation for dealing with paths and sequences more generally. 

Given a path (or sequence) $\rho = t_0\cdot t_1\cdot \ldots\cdot t_{n-1}$, the \textbf{tail} of $\rho$ is notated by $tail(\rho) = t_1\cdot \ldots\cdot t_{n-1}$. 
We may additionally use the notation $\rho_{i:j}$ to represent the subpath (or subsequence) $q_i\to q_{i+1}\to \ldots \to q_j$ of $\rho$. Using this notation, $tail(\rho) = \rho_{1:} = \rho_{1:n}$.

Whereas an individual transition reads in one real-valued input and outputted one output value, a path reads in a \textbf{sequence} of inputs and outputs a sequence of outputs, one for each transition in the path.

As before, we need to restrict the space of possible inputs to a path based on which locations in the path actually read in user input.
\begin{defn}
    For a path $\rho$ of length $n$, an input sequence $\texttt{in}\in \RR^n$ is valid if, for all $q_i$ in $\rho$ such that $q_i \in Q_{non}$, $\texttt{in}_i = 0$.  
\end{defn} 

We will assume that all input sequences are valid from now on. 

Interestingly, the constraints on valid transition alphabets, specifically the constraints of determinism and output distinction, mean that outputs uniquely correspond to paths; in other words, given a valid transition alphabet, knowing an output sequence uniquely determines which path must have produced the output. 

\begin{prop}
    Let $\Sigma_T$ be a valid transition alphabet and let $\Gamma$ be the finite output alphabet associated with $\Sigma_T$. Let $O\subset (\Gamma\cup\{\texttt{insample}, \texttt{insample}'\})^*$ be the set of all possible outputs of complete paths over $\Sigma_T$. There exists an injection $f: \Sigma_T\to t_{init}\Sigma_T^*$ from the set of all possible outputs to complete paths over $\Sigma_T$. 
\end{prop}

\subsubsection{Path Semantics}

As with transitions, we can think of paths as very limited programs consisting of a series of transitions concatenated together with a persistent threshold variable $\texttt{x}$. Naturally, paths will now consider as input a \textbf{sequence} of real numbers, and similarly output a \textbf{sequence} of real numbers or symbols - each transition reads in an input and outputs some value.

In particular, the semantics of a path $\rho = q_0\to \ldots \to q_n = t_0t_1\cdots t_{n-1}$ can be defined as the function $\Phi_{\rho}((q, \texttt{x}), \texttt{in}): S\times \RR^n\to dist(S\times (\RR\cup\Gamma\cup\lambda)^n)$ mapping an initial program state and a input sequence to a distribution of final program states and output sequences. 

$\Phi_{\rho}$ can be computed by composing the program semantics of individual transitions in the natural manner:

As before, let $\texttt{in}\in \RR^n$ be a sequence of inputs and let $\sigma \in (\Sigma\cup\Gamma\cup\lambda)^n$ be a sequence of possible output events.
Let $I\sim \Lap(\texttt{in}_0, \frac{1}{d_q\varepsilon})$ and $I'\sim \Lap(\texttt{in}_0, \frac{1}{d_q'\varepsilon})$ be independent random variables corresponding to $\texttt{insample}$ and $\texttt{insample}'$. 

Let $t_0 = (q, q', c_0, \sigma_0, \tau_0)$

Then \[
    \Phi_{\rho}((q, \texttt{x}), \texttt{in})((q', \texttt{x}'), \sigma) = \begin{cases}
        1 & ((q', \texttt{x}'), \sigma)=((q_0, \texttt{x}), \lambda)\land n = 0\\
        \PP[c_0\text{ is not satisfied}] & ((q', \texttt{x}'), \sigma) = ((q_{term}, \texttt{x}), \lambda)\land \tau_0 = \texttt{false} \\
        \PP[c_0\text{ is not satisfied}] & ((q', I), \sigma) = ((q_{term}, \texttt{x}), \lambda)\land \tau_0 = \texttt{true}\\
        \begin{gathered}
            \PP[c_0\text{ is satisfied}]*\\
            \Phi_{tail(\rho)}((q',\texttt{x}), tail(\texttt{in}))((q', \texttt{x}'), tail(\sigma))
        \end{gathered} & \sigma_0 \in \Gamma\land \tau_0 = \texttt{false}\\[15pt]
        \begin{gathered}
            \PP[c_0\text{ is satisfied}]*\\
            \Phi_{tail(\rho)}((q',I), tail(\texttt{in}))((q', \texttt{x}'), tail(\sigma))
        \end{gathered} & \sigma_0 \in \Gamma\land\tau_0 = \texttt{true}\\[15pt]
        \begin{gathered}
            \PP[c_0\text{ is satisfied}\land I \text{ matches }\sigma_0]*\\
            \Phi_{tail(\rho)}((q',\texttt{x}), tail(\texttt{in}))((q', \texttt{x}'), tail(\sigma))
        \end{gathered} & \sigma_0 = \texttt{insample}\land \tau_0 = \texttt{false}\\[15pt]
        \begin{gathered}
            \PP[c_0\text{ is satisfied}\land I \text{ matches }\sigma_0]*\\
            \Phi_{tail(\rho)}((q',I), tail(\texttt{in}))((q', \texttt{x}'), tail(\sigma))
        \end{gathered} & \sigma_0 = \texttt{insample}\land\tau_0 = \texttt{true}\\[15pt]
        \begin{gathered}
            \PP[c_0\text{ is satisfied}\land I' \text{ matches }\sigma_0]*\\
            \Phi_{tail(\rho)}((q',\texttt{x}), tail(\texttt{in}))((q', \texttt{x}'), tail(\sigma))
        \end{gathered} & \sigma_0 = \texttt{insample}'\land \tau_0 = \texttt{false}\\[15pt]
        \begin{gathered}
            \PP[c_0\text{ is satisfied}\land I' \text{ matches }\sigma_0]*\\
            \Phi_{tail(\rho)}((q',I), tail(\texttt{in}))((q', \texttt{x}'), tail(\sigma))
        \end{gathered} & \sigma_0 = \texttt{insample}'\land\tau_0 = \texttt{true}\\[15pt]
        0 & otherwise
    \end{cases}.
\]

As before, we primarily care about the probability of a ``successful'' execution of a path with a particular output, which we will denote as $\PP[\texttt{x}_0, \rho, \texttt{in}, \sigma]$, where $\texttt{x} \in \RR$ is the initial value of $\texttt{x}$, $\rho$ is the path we are concerned about, $\texttt{in}\in \RR^n$ is a real-valued input sequence, and $o\in (\Gamma\cup\Sigma\cup\lambda)^n$ is a possible output sequence of $\rho$. 
As before, $\PP[\texttt{x}_0, \rho, \texttt{in}, \sigma] =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \PP[\texttt{x}\gets \texttt{x}']\Phi_\rho((q_0, \texttt{x}_0), \texttt{in})((q_n, \texttt{x}'), \sigma)d\texttt{x}'$, where $t_0 = (q_0, q_1, c_0, \sigma_0, \tau_0)$ is the first character of $\rho$ and $t_{n-1} = (q_{n-1}, q_n, c_{n-1}, \sigma_{n-1}, \tau_{n-1})$ is the final character of $\rho$.

For a complete path $\rho$, note that the initial value of $\texttt{x}$ is irrelevant, so we will shorthand $\PP[\texttt{x}_0, \rho, \texttt{in}, \sigma]$ to $\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}, \sigma]$.


\subsubsection{Privacy}

By leveraging the construction of couplings for individual transitions, we can construct a set of approximate liftings for entire paths.

Because paths read in a \textit{sequence} of real-valued inputs, we need to slightly modify our definition of adjacency.

\begin{defn}[Adjacency for a sequence of inputs]
    Two input sequences $\{\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}\}_{i=1}^n, \{\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}\}_{i=1}^n$ of length $n$ are $\Delta$-adjacent (notated $\texttt{in}\brangle{1} \sim_{\Delta}\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$) if, for all $i\in [1\ldots n]$, $|\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}|\leq \Delta$. 

    As before, if $\Delta$ is not specified, we assume that $\Delta = 1$. 
\end{defn}

Thus, we have the following definition of privacy for complete paths:

\begin{defn}[$d\varepsilon$-differential privacy for a path]
    A complete path $\rho$ of length $n$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private for some $d>0$ if $\forall \varepsilon>0$, for all valid adjacent input sequences $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim \texttt{in}\brangle{2}$ of length $n$ and all possible output sequences $\sigma$ of length $n$, $\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \sigma]\leq e^{d\varepsilon}\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}\brangle{2}, \sigma]$.
\end{defn}

Because, under our model, a program is simply a collection of paths, it will also be convenient to define a notion of privacy for sets of (complete) paths:
\begin{defn}
    Let $S$ be a set of complete paths and let $O$ be a set of all possible outputs of paths in $S$. 
    Then $S$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private for some $d>0$ if, for all paths $\rho\in S$ and outputs $\sigma\in O$, $\forall \varepsilon>0$, for all valid adjacent input sequences $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim \texttt{in}\brangle{2}$, $\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \sigma]\leq e^{d\varepsilon}\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}\brangle{2}, \sigma]$.
\end{defn}

We observe that because of the path-output correspondence, we can equivalently look at each path of a set in isolation:
\begin{prop}
    Let $S$ be a set of complete paths; $S$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private for some $d>0$ if and only if, for all paths $\rho\in S$, $\rho$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private.
\end{prop}

Note that, following \cite{chadhaLinearTimeDecidability2021}, we slightly redefine $\varepsilon$-differential privacy as $d\varepsilon$-differential privacy, treating $\varepsilon$ as a universal scaling parameter that can be fine-tuned by users for their own purposes. 
We argue that this definition is functionally equivalent, since if we are targeting $\varepsilon^*$-differential privacy overall, we can always take $\varepsilon = \frac{\varepsilon^*}{d}$.

\subsubsection{Concatenating couplings}

Just as individual transitions can be concatenated to form program paths, we can compose together couplings associated with each transition to produce a coupling proof of privacy for an entire path. 

If $o\brangle{1}, o\brangle{2}$ are random variables representing the output of $\rho$ given input sequences $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}$ and $\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$, respectively, 
then in order to show that a program path $\rho$ is differentially private we want to create the coupling $o\brangle{1}\{(a, b): a=\sigma\implies b=\sigma\}^{\#d\varepsilon}o\brangle{2}$ for some $d>0$ for all adjacent inputs $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$ and all possible outputs $\sigma$.

As it turns out, directly composing together the couplings from lemma \ref{indTransitionCoupling} are essentially sufficient; the constraints imposed upon shifts for a coupling for transition $t_i$ depend solely on the shift at the most recent \textbf{assignment transition} in $\rho$ (i.e. the most recent transition $t_j$ such that $\tau_j = \texttt{true}$). 
The coupling shifts for \textit{non-assignment transitions} can thus never impact each other. 

\begin{defn}[Assignment transitions]
    Let $A_\rho = \{t_i=(q_i, q_{i+1}, c_i, \sigma_i, \tau_i): \tau_i = \texttt{true}\}$ be the set of \textbf{assignment transitions} in a path $\rho$. Additionally, for every transition $t_i$ in $\rho$, let $t_{at(i)}$ be the most recent assignment transition in $\rho$; i.e., $at(i) = \max\{j<i: t_j\in A_\rho\}$. If such a $j$ does not exist, we set $at(i)=-1$. 
\end{defn}

In particular, note that for transition $t_i$, $\gamma_x = \gamma_{at(i)}$, where $\gamma_{-1}$ is the shift applied to the initial $\texttt{x}$-values $\texttt{x}_0\brangle{1}$ and $\texttt{x}_0\brangle{2}$ (for complete paths, note that $\gamma_{-1}$ is irrelevant).

Thus, for an individual transition $t_i$ of $\rho$, we have a family of valid coupling strategies $C_i(\gamma_{at(i)}, \gamma_i, \gamma_i')$. 

We can merge these coupling strategies together to create a proof of privacy for the entire path: 

\begin{lemma}\label{multTransitionsCouplingProof}
    Let $\rho = q_0\to \ldots \to q_n$ be a complete path of length $n$. 
    Let $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim \texttt{in}\brangle{2}$ be arbitrary adjacent input sequences of length $n$. Additionally, fix some potential output $\sigma$ of $\rho$ of length $n$ and let $\sigma\brangle{1}$, $\sigma\brangle{2}$ be random variables representing possible outputs of $\rho$ given inputs $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}$ and $\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$, respectively. Additionally, for all $q_i$, let $P(q_i) = (d_i, d_i')$.

    Then $\forall \varepsilon>0$ and for all $\{\gamma_i, \gamma_i'\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ that, for all $i$, satisfy the constraints \[
        \begin{cases}
          \gamma_i\leq\gamma_{at(i)} & c_i = \lguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i\geq\gamma_{at(i)} & c_i = \gguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}\\
          \gamma_i'=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}'
        \end{cases},
      \]
      the lifting $\sigma\brangle{1}\{(a, b): a=\sigma\implies b=\sigma\}^{\#d\varepsilon}\sigma\brangle{2}$ is valid for $d = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i|)d_i+(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i'|)d_i'$, and therefore $t$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    From the proof of lemma \ref{indTransitionCoupling}, we know that we can create the couplings $\texttt{insample}_i\brangle{1} +\gamma_i{(=)}^{\#(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i|)d_i\varepsilon}\texttt{insample}_i\brangle{2}$ and $\texttt{insample}_i'\brangle{1} +\gamma_i'{(=)}^{\#(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i'|)d_i'\varepsilon}\texttt{insample}_i'\brangle{2}$ for all $q_i$ in $\rho$. 

    Additionally, for some fixed $q_i$ in $\rho$, if we have the coupling $\texttt{x}_i\brangle{1}+\gamma_x (=)^{\#(|\hat{\mu_i}\brangle{1}-\hat{\mu_i}\brangle{2}+\gamma_x|)\hat{d_i}\varepsilon}x_i\brangle{2}$, where $\texttt{x}_i\brangle{1}\sim \Lap(\hat{\mu_i}\brangle{1}, \frac{1}{\hat{d_i}\varepsilon})$ and $\texttt{x}_i\brangle{2}\sim \Lap(\hat{\mu_i}\brangle{2}, \frac{1}{\hat{d_i}\varepsilon})$, then subject to the constraints \[
        \begin{cases}
          \gamma_i\leq\gamma_x & c_i = \lguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i\geq\gamma_x & c_i = \gguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}_i\\
          \gamma_i'=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}_i'
        \end{cases},
      \]
    the coupling $\sigma_i\brangle{1}\{(a, b): a=\sigma_i\implies b=\sigma_i\}^{\#d\varepsilon}\sigma_i\brangle{2}$ is valid for some $d$. 

    Indeed, note that for all $i$, $\texttt{x}_i = \texttt{insample}_{at(i)}$ by definition. Thus, we have that $\texttt{x}_i\brangle{1}+\gamma_x (=)^{\#(|-\texttt{in}_{at(i)}\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_{at(i)}\brangle{2}+\gamma_{at(i)}|)d_{at(i)}\varepsilon}x_i\brangle{2}$, and we must satisfy the constraints \[
        \begin{cases}
          \gamma_i\leq\gamma_{at(i)} & c_i = \lguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i\geq\gamma_{at(i)} & c_i = \gguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}_i\\
          \gamma_i'=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}_i'
        \end{cases}
      \]
      for all $i$.

    Thus, we can put all of these couplings together to show that the coupling $\sigma_i\brangle{1}\{(a, b): a=\sigma_i\implies b=\sigma_i\}^{\#d\varepsilon}\sigma_i\brangle{2}$ is valid for some $d>0$.

    In particular, note that we have created at most one pair of couplings (for $\texttt{insample}$ and $\texttt{insample}$) for each $q_i$. Thus, the total coupling cost associated with each $q_i$ is at most $(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i|)d_i+(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i'|)d_i'$, 
    which gives us an overall coupling cost of $d = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i|)d_i+(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i'|)d_i'$.
\end{proof}

As with individual transitions, lemma \ref{multTransitionsCouplingProof} implicitly defines an entire family of possible coupling proofs that demonstrate the privacy of a path.

\begin{defn}
    For a complete path $\rho$ of length $n$, \textbf{coupling strategy} is a tuple of two functions $\bm{\gamma}(\texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \texttt{in}\brangle{2}):\RR^n\times \RR^n\to [-1, 1]^n$ and $\bm{\gamma}'(\texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \texttt{in}\brangle{2}):\RR^n\times \RR^n\to [-1, 1]^n$ that produce shifts for each transition of $\rho$ for every possible pair of adjacent input sequences $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$. 
    If $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}$ and $\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$ are clear from context, we will often shorthand notating a coupling strategy as $\bm{\gamma}$ and $\bm{\gamma}'$. 
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
    For a complete path $\rho$ of length $n$, a coupling strategy $C_\rho = (\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\gamma}')$ is \textbf{valid} if $\forall \texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$, $\bm{\gamma}(\texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \texttt{in}\brangle{2})$ and $\bm{\gamma}'(\texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \texttt{in}\brangle{2})$ satisfy the constraints \[
        \begin{cases}
          \gamma_i\leq\gamma_{at(i)} & c_i = \lguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i\geq\gamma_{at(i)} & c_i = \gguard[\texttt{x}]\\
          \gamma_i=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}\\
          \gamma_i'=0 & \sigma_i = \texttt{insample}'
        \end{cases}.
      \]
\end{defn}

Thus, if we have a \textbf{valid} coupling strategy $C$ for a path $\rho$, then immediately by lemma \ref{multTransitionsCouplingProof}, we have a proof that $\rho$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private. 

\sky{how necessary are these following defs/props}

\begin{defn}
    For a complete path $\rho$ of length $n$, the \textbf{cost} of a coupling strategy $C_\rho=(\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\gamma}')$ is \[cost(C_\rho) = \max_{\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i|)d_i+(|-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}+\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\gamma_i'|)d_i'.\]

    Additionally, let $G$ be the set of all valid coupling strategies $C_\rho=(\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\gamma}')$ for $\rho$. Then the \textbf{coupling cost} of $\rho$ is 
    \[cost(\rho) = \min_{(\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\gamma}')\in G}cost((\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\gamma}')).\]
\end{defn}

Naturally, the existence of a valid coupling strategy bounds the privacy cost of any path. 

\begin{cor}
    If $C_\rho=(\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\gamma}')$ is valid, then $\rho$ is $cost(C_\rho)\varepsilon$-differentially private.
\end{cor}
