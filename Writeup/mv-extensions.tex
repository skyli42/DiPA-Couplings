\section{Multiple Threshold Variable Programs}

We have shown the \textit{completeness} of coupling-based proofs of privacy for single-variable programs. However, it is also notable that coupling-based proofs allow for straightforward \textit{generalizations} to different program models that follow a similar paradigm. 

In particular, we show that coupling proofs can similarly be used to prove the privacy of an extended program model that allows for an \textit{arbitrary} number of threshold variables to compare inputs to. Indeed, we can again construct a series of ``coupling strategies'' parameterized by real-valued ``shifts''; we also show that, in the special case where there are two threshold variables, the existence of finite-cost coupling strategies again completely characterizes two-variable programs.
We finally conjecture that coupling proofs also characterize $k$-threshold variable programs in general. 

\subsection{Multivariable Transitions}

Our basic building block for programs with multiple threshold variables will be a single program \textit{transition}, as in the single variable case. 

\begin{defn}[$k$-variable guards]
    Let $\texttt{x}_1, \ldots \texttt{x}_k$ be real-valued program variables. Then a \textbf{$k$-variable guard} is a boolean statement $c = c^{(\texttt{x}_1)}\oplus_1 c^{(\texttt{x}_2)}\oplus_2\ldots\oplus_{k-1}c^{(\texttt{x}_k)}$ where for all $i$, \begin{itemize}
        \item $c^{(\texttt{x}_i)}\in \{\texttt{true}, \mvlguard[\texttt{x}_i], \mvgguard[\texttt{x}_i]\}$
        \item $\oplus_i \in \{\land, \lor\}$
    \end{itemize}
    Without loss of generality, we will assume that if the entire guard evaluates to a tautology, then $c^{(\texttt{x}_i)}=\texttt{true}$ for all $\texttt{x}_i$. Additionally, we will assume that all boolean operations in $c$ are left-associative. 
    
    
    % For example, we will disallow any guards of the form $c = \ldots \texttt{true}\lor \lguard[\texttt{x}_i]\ldots$, since the guard would simplify to $\texttt{true}$ (in which case, we suppose that for all $i$, $c^{(\texttt{x}_i)} = \texttt{true}$ and $\oplus_i = \land$). 

    Let $\mathcal{C}^{(k)}$ be the set of all possible guards with $k$ variables $\texttt{x}_1, \ldots \texttt{x}_k$.
\end{defn}

A multiple variable transition can thus be defined analogously single variable transitions; in particular, we will again take $\Gamma$ to be some finite alphabet of symbols that, along with real numbers, comprise the possible outputs of a transition. 

\begin{defn}[$k$-variable transitions]
    A $k$-variable transition ($k$v-transition) is a tuple $(c, \sigma, \tau)$ where \begin{itemize}
        \item $c\in\mathcal{C}^{(k)}$ is a transition guard.
        \item $\sigma\in\Gamma\cup\{\texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_1)}, \ldots, \texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_k)}, \texttt{insample}'\}$ is the output of the transition
        \item $\tau \in \{0\} \cup [k]$ indicates whether to assign $\texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_\tau)}$ into no variable (when $\tau = 0$) or $\texttt{x}_\tau$. In particular, note that only a single variable can be assigned into at a time and that every variable $\texttt{x}_i$ can only take its ``corresponding'' input value $\texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

We again associate every transition $t$ with two real-valued noise parameters $P(t) = (d, d')$.

\subsubsection{$k$-Variable Transition Semantics}

The semantics of $k$-variable transitions are defined analogously to single variable transitions. Specifically, a program state is a tuple consisting of a value for every threshold variable $\texttt{x}_i$ and a distribution of possible values for the current output $\sigma$. Let $S =\RR^k\times (\Gamma\cup \RR)^*$ be the set all possible program states. As expected, every possible input is simply an element of $\RR$. 

Then the semantics of a $k$v-transition $t$ can be defined as a function $\Phi_t: dist_\downarrow(S)\times \RR\to dist_\downarrow(S)$ that maps an subdistribution of initial program states and an input to a subdistribution of subsequent program states.

We sketch how $k$-variable transition semantics are defined informally; the precise semantics, as defined by $\Phi_t$, are analogous to the single variable case.

Given some threshold values $\texttt{x}_i\in \RR^k$, a transition $t = (c, \sigma, \tau)$, and spread parameter values $P(t) = (d, d')$, $t$ reads a real number input $\texttt{in}$ and 
samples $k$ \textbf{independent} random variables $z^{(\texttt{x}_1)}\sim\Lap(0, \frac{1}{d\varepsilon}),\ldots, z^{(\texttt{x}_k)}\sim\Lap(0, \frac{1}{d\varepsilon})$ for comparing a noised version of the input to each threshold variable as well as one random variable $z' \sim\Lap(0, \frac{1}{d\varepsilon})$ to potentially be used for outputting a re-noised version of the input. 

Using these noise variables, $t$ then assigns $k$ variables $\texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)} = \texttt{in} + z^{(x)}$ and an additional variable $\texttt{insample}' = \texttt{in} + z'$. 
If the guard $c$ is satisfied when comparing $\texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ to $\texttt{x}_i$ for all $i$, then the transition outputs $\sigma$ and, if $\tau\neq 0$, reassigns $\texttt{x}_{\tau} = \texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_\tau)}$.

We again denote the probability that a transition $t=(c, \sigma, \tau)$ outputs a specific measurable output event $o$ as $\PP[\vec{\texttt{x}}, t, \texttt{in}, o]$, where $\vec{\texttt{x}}\in \RR^k$ is a vector of initial values of all threshold values $\texttt{x}_i$, $\texttt{in}\in \RR$ is a real-valued input, and $o\subseteq \Gamma\cup\RR$is a possible measurable output event of $t$.

Specifically, if $\vec{\texttt{x}}\in \RR^k$ and $o$ is a measurable output event of $t$, then $\PP[\vec{\texttt{x}}, t, \texttt{in}, o]$ is the marginal of $\Phi_t((\vec{\texttt{x}}, \lambda), \texttt{in})$ on $(\cdot, o)$.

\subsection{Multivariable Couplings}

In this section, we introduce two approaches for constructing couplings for $k$v-transitions; the first approach constructs single variable couplings independently or ``in parallel'' for each variable, while the second coupling approach couples different program variables together to create contradictions or tautologies. 

We show that if we can create couplings for each variable of a $k$v-transition in isolation, then we can immediately create a coupling for a $k$v-transition. 

We must first define what it means to isolate a variable in a transition: 

\begin{defn}[Isolating a variable]
    Let $t = (c, \sigma, \tau)$ be a $k$-variable transition. For all $i$, $t^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ is the single variable transition $t^{(\texttt{x}_i)} = (c^{(\texttt{x}_i)}, \sigma^{(\texttt{x}_i)}, \tau^{(\texttt{x}_i)})$, where $c^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ is the $\texttt{x}_i$-component of $c$ as defined above, $\sigma^{(\texttt{x}_i)} = \begin{cases}
        \sigma & \sigma \in \Gamma\\
        \texttt{insample} & \sigma = \texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)}\\
        \texttt{insample}' & \sigma = \texttt{insample}'\\
        \bot & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$ and $\tau^{(\texttt{x}_i)} = \begin{cases}
        \texttt{true} & \tau = i\\
        \texttt{false} & \tau \neq i
    \end{cases}$, where $\bot$ is a unique ``junk'' symbol. We call $t^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ the $\texttt{x}_i$-\textbf{isolated} version of $t$. 
\end{defn}

By lemma \ref{simplifiedIndTransitionCoupling}, we know that, given a $k$v-transition $t$, we can create couplings for each $\texttt{x}_i$-isolated version of $t$. We demonstrate that this is sufficient to create couplings for $t$ as a whole. 

As in the single variable case, we create couplings from \textbf{coupling strategies}, i.e. a collection of shifts $C = (\gamma_{x_1}, \ldots, \gamma_{x_k}, \gamma_t^{(x_1)}, \ldots, \gamma_t^{(x_k)}, \gamma_t')$. Such a collection is valid if it satisfies the constraints below. 

\begin{lemma}\label{simplifiedMvParallelCouplingsLemma}
    For all $\varepsilon>0$, for any $k$v-transition $t$, measurable output event $\sigma$ of $t$, and adjacent inputs $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$, if we are given $2k+1$ real number ``shifts'' $\gamma_{x_1}, \ldots, \gamma_{x_k}, \gamma_t^{(x_1)}, \ldots, \gamma_t^{(x_k)}, \gamma_t'$ such that for all $1\leq i\leq k$, \[
        \begin{cases}
            \gamma_t^{(x_i)}\leq\gamma_{x_i} & c^{(\texttt{x}_i)} = \mvlguard[\texttt{x}_i]\\
            \gamma_t^{(x_i)}\geq\gamma_{x_i} & c^{(\texttt{x}_i)} = \mvgguard[\texttt{x}_i]\\
            \gamma_t^{(x_i)}=0 & \sigma = \texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)}\\
            \gamma_t'=0 & \sigma = \texttt{insample}'
      \end{cases},
      \]
      then we can construct an approximate lifting that proves $\PP[\vec{X}\brangle{1}, t, \texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \sigma]\leq e^{d\varepsilon}\PP[\vec{X}\brangle{2}, t, \texttt{in}\brangle{2}, \sigma]$ for some bounded $d>0$ and initial threshold Laplace-distributed variables $\vec{X}\brangle{1}$, $\vec{X}\brangle{2}\in \RR^k$.
\end{lemma}

To be precise, we show that $d = \sum_{i=1}^k\left(|\mu_{x_i}\brangle{1}-\mu_{x_i}\brangle{2}+\gamma_{x_i}|d_{x_i}+|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}+\gamma_t^{(x_i)}|d_t\right)+|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}+\gamma_t'|d_t'$;
the \textit{cost} for a $k$v-coupling strategy $C$ is thus \[cost(C) = \sup_{\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}}\sum_{i=1}^k\left(|\mu_{x_i}\brangle{1}-\mu_{x_i}\brangle{2}+\gamma_{x_i}|d_{x_i}+|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}+\gamma_t^{(x_i)}|d_t\right)+|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}+\gamma_t'|d_t'\] (see lemma \ref{mvParallelCouplingsLemma} in the appendix for a full proof).

This provides an extremely straightforward method of combining coupling strategies for different variables together.

\begin{cor}
    For a $k$v-transition $t$, if, for all $1\leq i\leq k$, there exists a coupling strategy $C_i$ such that $C_i$ is a valid coupling strategy for the isolated transition $t^{(x_i)}$, then there exists a valid coupling strategy $C$ for $t$ such that $cost(C)\leq \sum_{i=1}^k cost(C_i)$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    Let $t = (c, \sigma, \tau)$ and for all $i$, let $C_i = (\gamma_{x_i}, \gamma_t^{(x_i)}, \gamma_t^{(x_i)\prime})$ be the single variable coupling strategy for the isolated transition $t^{(x_i)} = (c^{(x_i)}, \sigma^{(x_i)}, \tau^{(x_i)})$. 
    
    Take $C = (\gamma_{x_1}, \ldots, \gamma_{x_k}, \gamma_t^{(x_1)}, \ldots, \gamma_t^{(x_k)}, \gamma_t')$, where $\gamma_t' = 0$.

    Because $C_i$ is valid for all $i$, we know that if $c^{(x_i)} = \lguard$, then $\gamma_t^{(x_i)}\leq \gamma_{x_i}$ and if $c^{(x_i)} = \gguard$, then $\gamma_t^{(x_i)}\geq \gamma_{x_i}$. Similarly, if $\sigma = \texttt{insample}^{(x_i)}$, then $\sigma^{(x_i)} = \texttt{insample}$, so $\gamma_t^{(x_i)} = 0$. Thus, for all $i$, the first three conditions of validity of $C$ are satisfied. Finally, since $\gamma_t' = 0$, the fourth condition of validity is satisfied as well, so $C$ is valid.
    
    Observer that for all $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$, $\sum_{i=1}^k(|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}|)d_t'\geq (|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}|)d_t'$. 
    So \begin{alignat*}{2}
        \sum_{i=1}^k cost(C_i) &= \sum_{i=1}^k\sup_{\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}}(&(|\mu_{x_i}\brangle{1}-\mu_{x_i}\brangle{2}+\gamma_{x_i}|)d_{x_i}+(|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}+\gamma_t^{(x_i)}|)d_t\\ & &+(|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}+\gamma_t^{(x_i)\prime}|)d_t')\\
        &\geq \sup_{\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}}\sum_{i=1}^k(&(|\mu_{x_i}\brangle{1}-\mu_{x_i}\brangle{2}+\gamma_{x_i}|)d_{x_i}+(|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}+\gamma_t^{(x_i)}|)d_t)\\
         & &+(|\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\texttt{in}\brangle{2}|)d_t'\\
        &= cost(C) &
    \end{alignat*}
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Cross-Couplings}

We introduce cross-couplings, which couple together \textit{different} program variables to produce valid approximate liftings. 

Intuitively, cross-couplings allow us to construct liftings for certain transitions ``for free'' in a manner compatible with existing liftings, dependent on the initial threshold distributions. 

In particular, cross-couplings can be applied to transitions whose guards correspond to checking if an input is within either the empty set or the entire real line, which are either always true or always false. By deriving either a tautology or a contradiction, the implication statement that must hold for a valid approximate lifting is shown to be trivially satisfied. 

The construction of cross-couplings for a transition is dependent both on any existing \textit{shifts} (from, for example, parallel single variable couplings) and the initial distribution of program variables --- in particular, the construction depends on the means of the initial distributions of each program variable. 

We say that a collection of means $\{\mu_i\brangle{1}, \mu_i\brangle{2}\}_{i=1}^k$ and shifts $\gamma_{x_1},\ldots,\gamma_{x_k}$ \textbf{allow for a cross coupling} for a transition $t$ if either of the first two conditions in the following lemma (lemma \ref{mvCrossCoupling}) are satisfied for $\mu$ and $\gamma$. 

\begin{lemma}\label{mvCrossCoupling}
    Let $\vec{X}\brangle{1} = (X_1\brangle{1}, \ldots X_k\brangle{1})$ where $X_i\brangle{1}\sim \Lap(\mu_i\brangle{1}, \frac{1}{d_x\varepsilon})$ are independent random variables and $\vec{X}\brangle{2} = (X_1\brangle{2}, \ldots X_k\brangle{2})$ where $X_i\brangle{2}\sim \Lap(\mu_{x_i}\brangle{2}, \frac{1}{d_x\varepsilon})$ 
    are independent random variables be such that, for all $i$, $\mu_i\brangle{1}\sim \mu_i\brangle{2}$ are adjacent input values.

    Then for any coupling strategy $\gamma_{x_1}, \ldots, \gamma_{x_k}, \gamma_t^{(x_1)}, \ldots, \gamma_t^{(x_k)}, \gamma_t'$ for a transition $t = (c, \sigma,\tau)$, if one of the following is true: \begin{enumerate}
        \item The boolean expression produced from $c$ by setting all $\texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ equal to each other and setting $\texttt{x}_i = \mu_i\brangle{1}$ for all $i$ is a contradiction.
        \item The boolean expression produced from $c$ by setting all $\texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ equal to each other and setting $\texttt{x}_i = \mu_i\brangle{2}$ for all $i$ is a tautology.
    \end{enumerate}
    and, additionally, the following two conditions hold: \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\sigma = \texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$, then $\gamma_t^{(\texttt{x}_i)}=0$
            \item If $\sigma = \texttt{insample}'$, then $\gamma_t'=0$
    \end{itemize}
    then we can construct an approximate lifting that proves $\PP[\vec{X}\brangle{1}, t, \texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \sigma]\leq e^{d\varepsilon}\PP[\vec{X}\brangle{2}, t, \texttt{in}\brangle{2}, \sigma]$ for some $d>0$. 
\end{lemma}

Note that cross-couplings require every single component of the initial variable distribution to have the same spread parameter.

\subsection{Multivariable Paths}

By sequentially concatenating $k$v-transitions, we can again create $k$-variable path programs, which represent executions of a program in our program model. 

\begin{defn}[$k$-variable paths]
    A $k$-variable path ($k$v-path) is a finite string of $k$v-transitions. Analogously to single variable paths, we call a $k$v-path $\rho = t_0t_1\ldots t_{n-1}$, \textbf{initialized} if, for all $0\leq i < k$, $t_i = (\texttt{true}, \sigma_i, i+1)$ for some $\sigma_i$.
\end{defn}

The semantics of a $k$v-path are again defined by composing the semantics of each individual transition in the path; we denote the probability of a path $\rho$ outputting a specific measurable output sequence event $\sigma$ given initial threshold distributions $\vec{\texttt{x}}$ and input sequence $\texttt{in}$ as $\PP[\vec{\texttt{x}}, \rho, \texttt{in}, \sigma]$, which we shorthand to $\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}, \sigma]$ when $\rho$ is an initialized path.

Analogously to single variable paths, we will use the notation $t_{at_j(i)}$ to refer to the assignment transition for variable $\texttt{x}_j$ that immediately precedes transition $t_i$ within a path. 

As previously noted, cross-couplings require that the spread parameter of threshold variables are identical across variables; we thus say that a path $\rho = t_0\ldots t_{n-1}$ \textbf{allows for cross-couplings} if there exists some constant $d_{at}>0$ such that, for every assignment transition $t_i$ of $\rho$, $P(t_i) = (d_{at}, d'_i)$. 


Combining our ``parallel'' and ``cross'' coupling strategies allows us to create $k$v-path coupling strategies:

\begin{defn}[$k$-variable Coupling Strategies]
    A $k$v-coupling strategy for a $k$v-path $\rho$ of length $n$ is a collection of shifts $\{\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_1)},\ldots, \gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_k)}, \gamma_i'\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ such that every $\{\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_1)},\ldots, \gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_k)}, \gamma_i'\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ is a function of two adjacent input sequences $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim \texttt{in}\brangle{2}$ with range $[-1, 1]$. 
    We call a coupling strategy \textbf{valid} if, for \textbf{all} input sequences $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$, it satisfies the constraints in lemma \ref{mvPathCouplingLemma}.
\end{defn}

As expected, if a coupling strategy satisfies certain conditions (see lemma \ref{mvPathCouplingLemma}), then we can use it to prove that a path is private. 

\begin{lemma}\label{mvPathCouplingLemma}
    Let $\rho = t_0\ldots t_{n-1}$ be a initialized $k$v-path of length $n$ where $t_i = (c_i, \sigma_i, \tau_i)$ and $P(t_i) = (d_i, d'_i)$ for all $i$. 
    Let $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim \texttt{in}\brangle{2}$ be arbitrary adjacent input sequences of length $n$. Additionally, fix some potential measurable output sequence event $\sigma$ of $\rho$ of length $n$.

    Then $\forall \varepsilon>0$ and for all $\{\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_1)},\ldots, \gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_k)}, \gamma_i'\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ that, for all $0\leq i\leq n-1$ and $1\leq j\leq k$ satisfy the following constraints:\begin{enumerate}
        \item If $c_i$ is satisfied in run $\brangle{1}$, then $c_i$ is satisfied in run $\brangle{2}$; i.e. at least one of the following is true:\begin{enumerate}
            \item $\{\texttt{in}_{at_1(i)}\brangle{1}, \texttt{in}_{at_1(i)}\brangle{2}, \ldots, \texttt{in}_{at_k(i)}\brangle{1}, \texttt{in}_{at_k(i)}\brangle{2}\}$ and $\gamma_{at_1(i)}^{(\texttt{x}_1)}, \ldots, \gamma_{at_k(i)}^{(\texttt{x}_k)}$ allow for a cross coupling for $t_i$.
            \item For all $1\leq j \leq k$, if $c_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)} = \mvlguard[\texttt{x}_j]$, then $\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)}\leq \gamma^{(\texttt{x}_j)}_{at_j(i)}$ and if $c_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)} = \mvgguard[\texttt{x}_j]$, then $\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)}\geq \gamma^{(\texttt{x}_j)}_{at_j(i)}$.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item If $t_i$ outputs the specific value $o_i$ in run $\brangle{1}$, then $t_i$ also outputs $o_i$ in run $\brangle{2}$; i.e. both of the following must be true: \begin{enumerate}
            \item If $\sigma_i = \texttt{insample}^{(\texttt{x}_j)}$, then $\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)}=0$
            \item If $\sigma_i = \texttt{insample}'$, then $\gamma_i'=0$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
     we can construct an approximate lifting that proves $\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}\brangle{1}, \sigma]\leq e^{d\varepsilon}\PP[\rho, \texttt{in}\brangle{2}, \sigma]$ for $d = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(|\texttt{in}\brangle{2}-\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\gamma_i'|d_i'+\sum_{j=1}^k|\texttt{in}\brangle{2}-\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)}|d_i\right)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Follows from lemmas \ref{simplifiedMvParallelCouplingsLemma} and \ref{mvCrossCoupling} exactly as lemma \ref{multTransitionsCouplingProof} follows from lemma \ref{indTransitionCoupling}.
\end{proof}

We denote the cost of a coupling strategy $C=\{\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_1)},\ldots, \gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_k)}, \gamma_i'\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ for a $k$v-path $\rho$ as $cost(C) = \max_{\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(|\texttt{in}\brangle{2}-\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\gamma_i'|d_i'+\sum_{j=1}^k|\texttt{in}\brangle{2}-\texttt{in}\brangle{1}-\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)}|d_i\right)$.

\subsection{$k$v-Programs}

As in the single variable case, we model programs that can be represented by a finite control flow graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a finite set of program locations, and each edge $e\in E$ is labeled with a function $T(e)$ such that $T(e)$ is a $k$v-transition. 

For clarity, we call control flow graphs for $k$-variable programs $k$v-CFGs. 

\begin{defn}
    A $k$v-CFG $G = (V, E)$ is \textbf{proper} if it satisfies the following conditions: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Initialization:} The first $k$ transitions $t_1\ldots t_k$ of any execution of $G$ must be such that $t_i$ is a transition with guard $\texttt{true}$ that assigns into $\texttt{x}_i$.
        
        More precisely, $V$ must contain unique initial locations $\ell_{init}^{(x_1)}, \ldots \ell_{init}^{(x_k)}\in V$ such that for all $1\leq i \leq k$, there exists exactly one edge $e_{init}^{(x_i)}\in E$ that has a source at $\ell_{init}^{(x_i)}$. Additionally, for all $1\leq i <k$, $e_{init}^{(x_i)} = (\ell_{init}^{(x_{i})}, \ell_{init}^{(x_{i+1})})$. Finally, for all $1\leq i \leq k$, $T(e_{init}^{(x_i)})$ must be of the form $(\texttt{true}, \sigma_i, i)$ for some $\sigma_i$.
        \item \textbf{Determinism:} For all locations $\ell\in V$, if there exist distinct edges $(\ell, \ell')$ labeled by $t'=(c', \sigma', \tau')$ and $(\ell, \ell^*)$ labeled by $t^* = (c^*, \sigma^*, \tau^*)$, then $c'$ and $c^*$ must be logically disjoint; i.e. the boolean expression $c' \land c^*$ must be a contradiction. 
        In particular, note that this means that if there exists an edge $(\ell, \ell')\in E$ labeled by a transition of the form $(\texttt{true}, \sigma, \tau)$, then there does not exist another edge in $E$ with source at $\ell$.
        \item \textbf{Shared Noise:} For all locations $\ell\in V$ and any two edges $(\ell, \ell')$ labeled by $t'=(c', \sigma', \tau')$ and $(\ell, \ell^*)$ labeled by $t^* = (c^*, \sigma^*, \tau^*)$, $P(t') = P(t^*)$. 
        % \item \textbf{Public Input:} For all locations $\ell\in V$, if there exists some edge $e = (\ell, \ell') \in E$ such that $e$ is labeled by a public transition, then every other edge from $\ell$ must also be labeled by a public transition. 
        \item \textbf{Cross Coupling Compatibility:} There exists some constant $d_{at}>0$ such that for every edge $e\in E$ labeled by the transition $t = (c, \sigma, \tau)$, if $\tau \neq 0$ (i.e. $t$ is an assignment transition), $P(t) = (d_{at}, d'_t)$ for some $d'_t >0$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

We will again use $\Psi(r)$ to denote the forgetful homomorphism from an execution $r$ of $G$ that drops all program locations from $r$ to produce a $k$v-path and say that $\{\Psi(r): r\text{ is a execution of }G\}$ is the set of $k$v-paths \textbf{generated} by a proper $k$v-CFG $G$. 

Naturally, $k$v-programs can be defined using a $k$v-CFG in analogy to the single variable case. 

\begin{defn}
    A $k$v-program $P$ is a language over a finite alphabet of $k$v-transitions generated by a proper $k$v-CFG $G$. 
\end{defn}

Observe that a $k$v-program is still a regular language, simply over a finite alphabet of $k$v-transitions rather than single variable transitions. Thus, we again apply the decomposition result of \cite{afoninMinimalUnionFreeDecompositions2009} and analyze every $k$v-program as a finite collection of \textbf{trajectories}.

\begin{defn}[$k$-variable Trajectories]
    A $k$v-trajectory $L$ is a union-free regular language generated by a proper $k$v-CFG $G$. 
\end{defn}

We again associate a single coupling strategy with every $k$v-trajectory:

\begin{defn}[Coupling strategy for a $k$v-trajectory]
    Let $L$ be a $k$v-trajectory generated by the graph $G_L = (V_L, E_L)$, where $m = |E_L|$. Then a coupling strategy $C = \{\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_1)},\ldots, \gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_k)}, \gamma_i'\}_{i=0}^{m-1}$ for $L$ is a function $C:E_L\times\RR \times\RR\to [-1, 1]^{k+1}$ that computes $k+1$ shifts for each transition-labeled edge in $L$ as a function of two adjacent inputs.
\end{defn}

A coupling strategy for a $k$v-trajectory $L$ induces a coupling strategy for each $k$v-path in $L$ in the same manner as the single variable case (see definition \ref{svInducedCouplingStrategy}). 

As expected, the cost $cost(C)$ of a coupling strategy $C$ for a $k$v-trajectory $L$ is the supremum of the costs of the $k$v-path coupling strategies induced by $C$ over all paths in $L$.

We can also directly translate the constraints for a coupling strategy to have finite cost from single variable trajectories to define the multivariable privacy constraint system.

\begin{defn}\label{mvPrivacyConstraintSystem}
    Let $L$ be a $k$v-trajectory generated by $G_L = (V_L, E_L)$ and let $C = \{\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_1)},\ldots, \gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_k)}, \gamma_i'\}_{i=0}^{m-1}$ be a coupling strategy for $L$. If, for every path $\rho$ in $L$, the coupling strategy for $\rho$ induced by $C$ satisfies the constraints from lemma \ref{mvPathCouplingLemma} as well as the following constraints for all input sequences $\texttt{in}\brangle{1}\sim\texttt{in}\brangle{2}$ and all $i$: \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{2}
        \item If $\Psi^{-1}(t_i)$ is in a cycle in $G_L$, then for all $1\leq j\leq k$, $\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_j)} = -\texttt{in}\brangle{1}_i+\texttt{in}\brangle{2}_i$
        \item If $\Psi^{-1}(t_i)$ is in a cycle in $G_L$, then $\gamma_i' = -\texttt{in}\brangle{1}_i+\texttt{in}\brangle{2}_i$
    \end{enumerate}
    then we say that $C$ satisfies the privacy constraint system for $L$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
    If a coupling strategy $C$ satisfies the privacy constraint system for a $k$v-trajectory $L$, then $cost(C)<\infty$ and $L$ is $cost(C)\varepsilon$-differentially private. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Because the privacy constraint system includes constraints for validity by definition, we know that $C$ is a valid coupling strategy. In particular, by lemma \ref{mvPathCouplingLemma}, this means that $C$ will produce a proof that $L$ is $cost(C)\varepsilon$-differentially private. 
    
    It remains to show that $C$ has finite cost. For every path $\rho\in L$, let $\rho^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ be the single variable path created from $\rho$ by isolating every transition to the variable $\texttt{x}_i$. 

    Because of constraints (3) and (4), we know that, for all $\texttt{x}_i$, $\sup_{\rho\in L}\sum_{i=0}^{|\rho|-1}|\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}-\gamma_i^{(\texttt{x}_i)}|d_i + |\texttt{in}_i\brangle{2}-\texttt{in}_i\brangle{1}-\gamma_i'|d_i'$ is finite by applying lemma \ref{finiteCostConstraintLemma} to $\rho^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ and a single variable coupling strategy constructed using $(\gamma^{(\texttt{x}_i)}, \gamma')$. 

    This immediately implies that $cost(C)$ is finite as well, since there are a finite number of program variables. 
\end{proof}

Thus, we can extend corollary \ref{svProgramPrivacyCorollary} to multiple variable programs. 

\begin{lemma}
    If, for every trajectory $L$ in $P$, there exists a valid coupling strategy $C_L$, then $P$ is $cost(P) = (\max_{L\subseteq P} cost(C_L))\varepsilon$-differentially private. In particular, if for every $L\subseteq P$ there exists a coupling strategy for $L$ that satisfies the privacy constraint system, then $P$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private for some finite $d>0$.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Demonstrating Violations of Privacy for 2-variable programs}

We have shown that, using parallel and cross-couplings, couplings can be used to generate proofs of privacy for any $k$-variable program that satisfies the privacy constraint system. 

Unlike the single variable case, we do not show that the privacy constraint system is complete for an arbitrary number of variables. We discuss some of the difficulties in generalizing violations of privacy to $k$ variables in section \ref{generalizingToKVariables}.

However, we do have completeness in the special case when we have $k=2$ variables. We show that in this case (whose variables we now label $\texttt{x}$ and $\texttt{y}$) the privacy constraint system for a 2v-program is complete for output-distinct programs. 

As with the single variable case, if the privacy constraint system is unsatisfiable for a program $P$ generated by $G$, we demonstrate that there must exist specific graph structures that correspond to a violation of privacy.

In general, these graph structures directly correspond to the single variable case; indeed, with one exception, we can identify these structures by looking at the generating graph of a program \textit{isolated} to a single variable. 

We will use $G^{(\texttt{x}_i)}$ to denote the $k$v-CFG $G = (V, E)$ where each edge label $T(e)$ is replaced by the $\texttt{x}_i$-isolation of $T(e)$. 

Identifying leaking cycles, disclosing cycles, and privacy violating paths in any variable $\texttt{x}_i$ for the $\texttt{x}$-isolated graph $G$ is sufficient to produce a violation of privacy in the two variable case; we must account for a special kind of leaking pair that turns out to be provably private using cross-couplings. 

\begin{defn}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a 2v-transition labeled graph with variables $\texttt{x}$, $\texttt{y}$ and let $(C, C')$ be a leaking pair in either $G^{(\texttt{x})}$ or $G^{(\texttt{y})}$ such that there is a path from $C$ to $C'$ with no assignment transitions into the other variable. For every edge $e\in E$, let $t_e = (c_e, \sigma_e, \tau_e)$ be the 2v-transition that labels $e$. 
    If at least one of the following is true for $C, C'$: \begin{itemize}
        \item For all $e\in C\cup C'$, $c_e \in \{\texttt{true}, \mvlguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvgguard[\texttt{y}], \mvgguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvlguard[\texttt{y}]\}$
        \item For all $e\in C\cup C'$, $c_e \in \{\texttt{true}, \mvlguard[\texttt{x}]\lor\mvgguard[\texttt{y}], \mvgguard[\texttt{x}]\lor\mvlguard[\texttt{y}]\}$
\end{itemize}
then we say $(C, C')$ is a cancelling leaking pair. 
\end{defn}

Intuitively, the reason that cancelling leaking pairs are private is that for any threshold variable distributions with means at $\mu_x,\mu_y$, at least one of $\mu_x\geq\mu_y$ or $\mu_x\leq \mu_y$ must always be true no matter what input sequence we are given. 
Thus, for example, either all of the transitions with guard $\mvlguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvgguard[\texttt{y}]$ or all of the transitions with guard $\mvgguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvlguard[\texttt{y}]$ allow for a ``free'' cross coupling, while the other set of transitions can be coupled for finite cost in a standard manner.

Incorporating this exception, we show that an unsatisfiable coupling strategy still implies the presence of these ``bad'' graph structures. 

\begin{lemma}
    If no coupling strategy for a 2v-trajectory $L$ satisfies the privacy constraint system, then there exists a leaking cycle, non-cancelling leaking pair, disclosing cycle, or privacy violating path in either $\texttt{x}$ or $\texttt{y}$ in $L$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose that we have some maximally satisfied coupling strategy $C$ for $L$. There must be some constraint that is violated by $C$. Note that if constraint (11) is violated, then there must be a leaking cycle in $L$ since we only allow cross-couplings between assignment transitions. 

    Thus, we can assume that constraint (11) is not violated. 

    By lemma \ref{ProgramCounterexampleThm}, there must then be either a leaking cycle, leaking pair, disclosing cycle, or privacy violating path with respect to a single variable. 

    We will show that, if there only exist leaking pairs in $L$, then at least one leaking pair must be a non-cancelling leaking pair. 

    For the sake of contradiction, suppose that every leaking pair $\kappa, \kappa'$ in $L$ is a cancelling leaking pair. 

    By definition, this means that for every two transitions $t_i, t_j$ in $\kappa, \kappa'$, $at_x(i) = at_x(j)$ and $at_y(i) = at_y(j)$.

    Without loss of generality, we will assume that every non-$\texttt{true}$ transition in $\kappa$ must either have guard $\mvlguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvgguard[\texttt{y}]$ or $\mvlguard[\texttt{x}]\lor\mvgguard[\texttt{y}]$. Thus, every non-$\texttt{true}$ transition in $\kappa'$ must either have guard $\mvgguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvlguard[\texttt{y}]$ or $\mvgguard[\texttt{x}]\lor\mvlguard[\texttt{y}]$, respectively. 

    Let $t_i$ be an arbitrary non-$\texttt{true}$ transition in $\kappa$ and $t_j$ be an arbitrary non-$\texttt{true}$ transition in $\kappa'$.

    Consider the case where $c_i = \mvlguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvgguard[\texttt{y}]$ and $c_j = \mvgguard[\texttt{x}]\land\mvlguard[\texttt{y}]$; the other case is symmetric.

    Observe that at least one of $\texttt{in}_{at_x(i)}\brangle{1}\leq \texttt{in}_{at_y(i)}\brangle{1}$ or $\texttt{in}_{at_y(i)}\brangle{1}\geq \texttt{in}_{at_y(i)}\brangle{1}$ must be true. Suppose that $\texttt{in}_{at_x(i)}\brangle{1}\leq \texttt{in}_{at_y(i)}\brangle{1}$. The case where $\texttt{in}_{at_y(i)}\brangle{1}\geq \texttt{in}_{at_y(i)}\brangle{1}$ is symmetric. 

    Then we can set $\gamma_{at_x(i)} = -1$, $\gamma_{at_y(i)}=1$, and $\gamma_{(at_x(i), at_y(i))} =  -\max(0, \texttt{in}_{at_x(i)}\brangle{1}+ \gamma_{at_x(i)}^{(x)}-\texttt{in}_{at_y(i)}\brangle{1}-\gamma_{at_y(i)}^{(y)})$. 
    
    Because there do not exist disclosing cycles, leaking cycles, or privacy violating paths in either variable, this cannot violate any further constraints. Thus, $C$ is not maximal, which is our contradiction, so $L$ must contain either a leaking cycle, disclosing cycle, privacy violating path, or non-cancelling leaking pair in at least one variable.
\end{proof}

Finally, through a careful analysis, we extend the single variable DiPA counterexample results to two variables to show that the presence of these bad graph structures in a generating graph $G$ for a program $P$ implies that $P$ is not differentially private. 

As in the single variable case, this result holds for the class of programs whose paths can be uniquely identified with specific outputs, which we call output-distinct (see definition \ref{outputDistinctionDef}).


\begin{lemma}
    Consider a 2v-program $P$ generated by $G$. If $G$ satisfies output distinction and there exists a leaking cycle, disclosing cycle, or privacy violating path in a single variable or a non-cancelling leaking pair in either $\texttt{x}$ or $\texttt{y}$, then $P$ is not $d\varepsilon$-differentially private for any $d>0$. 
\end{lemma}

We conclude that the privacy constraint system completely characterizes privacy even for 2 variable programs.

\begin{thm}
    A 2v-program $P$ is $d\varepsilon$-differentially private for some $d>0$ if and only if there exists coupling strategy for every trajectory of $P$ that satisfies the privacy constraint system.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Beyond Two Variables}\label{generalizingToKVariables}

We have shown that for an arbitrary number of variables, we can produce a set of candidate coupling proofs that can potentially prove that a $k$v-program is private. As in the single variable case, these coupling proofs can be characterized by a system of linear constraints; if the system is satisfiable for a $k$v-program, then the program is differentially private. Additionally, we showed that the constraint system is complete for 2 variable programs specifically. 

We conjecture this constraint system is still in fact complete for $k>2$ variables; our proofs for counterexamples to privacy for $2$v-programs are currently specific to two variable programs, but it is possible that they can be extended through a more careful analysis. In particular, it may be possible to ``group'' pairs of single-variable guards together and analyze them as a single unit to reduce the general $k$-variable problem to a 2-variable problem. 

In a similar vein, we conjecture that it is possible to extend the definition of a multi-variable transition guard to encompass \textit{any} boolean function of inputs of the form $\{\texttt{true}, \mvlguard[\texttt{x}_i], \mvgguard[\texttt{x}_i]\}$; indeed, satisfying the same system of linear constraints would still produce correct proofs of differential privacy, but it is unclear how to demonstrate completeness for guards that can be arbitrary boolean functions. 


\section{Conclusion}
We have shown how to use coupling techniques to prove privacy for a class of SVT-like programs first defined in \cite{chadhaLinearTimeDecidability2021} and discovered that couplings additionally characterize this class. We additionally showed that this can be done tractably, and that couplings can help provide lower bounds on privacy costs of these algorithms. 

Future work most naturally would focus on extensions of the program model. For the model, potential areas include removing the requirement for output to be deterministic of a path through the automaton, which would allow for algorithms such as Report Noisy Max to be captured by the model. Similarly, the alphabet of the automaton could be expanded to incorporate more than comparisons between two real numbers. 
Such extensions would naturally also require extensions of the class of couplings we define here, which are limited to ``shifts''. 

Additionally, we believe that couplings should completely characterize GDiPAs as well as DiPAs; proving this requires showing that a lack of well-formedness in any single variable generates a counterexample to privacy. 
In this vein, we would like to explore using couplings to \textit{disprove} privacy; the fact that shift couplings completely characterize DiPAs hints at the possibility of ``anti-couplings'' to generate counterexamples.
